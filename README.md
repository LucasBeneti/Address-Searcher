# Address-Searcher

It is my very first finished project, and the reason I did it is that I wanted to learn more about basic structuring and design of a full project. It is simple, but it's nice. What the project is for is basicly self explanatory by it's name. You can search for addresses of cryptowallets in different Blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash and Dogecoin. And there's also a section where I try to explain in my best words what is a Blockchain and it's aspects that comes with it. I used Heroku to host the project, since it was my first project that I felt like it, so here's a preview (https://intelligent-moliere-84041.herokuapp.com/).
